## Code Review Report: `hypkg` CLI Tool

### File Reviewed: `utils.js`

1.  **Summary**:
    *   This module provides core utility functions for the `hypkg` CLI. Its primary responsibilities include executing Git commands (`execGit`), managing Git state (stashing, checking out branches, resetting, getting commits/branches), handling repository remotes, managing `package-lock.json` conflicts and dependencies (`handlePackageChanges`), and basic logging (`log`). It serves as the main interface for interacting with the underlying Git repository and file system for higher-level commands in `cli.js`.

2.  **Key Metrics** (Estimates):
    *   Lines of Code: ~290
    *   Complexity: Moderate. Functions like `handlePackageChanges` and `restoreGitState` have multiple steps and conditional paths. `execGit` centralizes complexity but interactions remain intricate.
    *   Test Coverage: 0% (No tests provided).

3.  **Strengths**:
    *   **Centralized Git Interaction**: `execGit` provides a single point for executing Git commands, simplifying calls from `cli.js` and offering a basic layer for error handling and debugging output.
    *   **State Management Abstraction**: `saveGitState` and `restoreGitState` abstract the complex process of saving and restoring the repository state, crucial for commands that perform risky operations.
    *   **Modularity**: Groups related functionalities (Git utils, Repo management, Branch management, Package management, Logging).
    *   **Clear Logging**: The `log` function provides consistent, prefixed console output.
    *   **Use of Modern JS**: Leverages `async/await` for cleaner asynchronous operations.

4.  **Issues**:
    *   **Major**: **Lack of Testing**: The absence of automated tests is critical, especially given the module's direct manipulation of Git state and the file system. This makes refactoring highly risky.
    *   **Major**: **Potential Error Swallowing**: Some `fs` promise `.catch(() => {})` blocks (e.g., `fs.unlink` in `handlePackageChanges`) might silently ignore errors, potentially leading to unexpected states. `execGit` catches errors but re-throws them with a generic prefix, which might obscure the original Git error details crucial for debugging.
    *   **Minor**: **Limited Documentation**: While function names are mostly clear, JSDoc comments explaining parameters, return values, potential side effects (especially file system/Git state changes), and error conditions are missing for most functions.
    *   **Minor**: **Complexity in `handlePackageChanges`**: This function handles several distinct scenarios (lock file conflict, lock file missing, standard install check) and could be broken down for better readability and testability.
    *   **Minor**: **Magic Strings/Values**: Git command arguments, error message prefixes, and stash message formats are hard-coded.
    *   **Minor**: **Basic Debug Flag**: The `DEBUG` flag is rudimentary; a more robust logging library or mechanism would be beneficial for diagnostics.

5.  **Refactoring Plan**:
    *   **(High Priority / Hard Effort)**: **Introduce Testing**: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests. Mock `execa` and `fs` for unit tests. Create integration tests that run against a temporary Git repository to validate state management and Git operations.
        *   *Technique*: Test-Driven Development (TDD) for new features/refactors, adding tests incrementally for existing code.
        *   *Benefits*: Enables safe refactoring, prevents regressions, documents behavior.
        *   *Risks*: Time-consuming initially, requires careful setup for Git integration testing.
    *   **(Medium Priority / Medium Effort)**: **Refactor `handlePackageChanges`**: Break down the function into smaller, single-purpose functions (e.g., `resolveLockConflict`, `ensureDependenciesInstalled`, `checkLockfileStatus`).
        *   *Technique*: Extract Method.
        *   *Benefits*: Improved readability, testability, and maintainability. Easier to understand the different dependency handling flows.
        *   *Risks*: Need careful testing to ensure all original scenarios are still covered correctly.
    *   **(Medium Priority / Easy Effort)**: **Improve Error Handling**: Enhance `execGit` to retain or expose more specific details from the original Git error. Avoid silent error swallowing in `fs` operations; log warnings or re-throw specific errors where appropriate.
        *   *Technique*: Custom Error Types, Error Wrapping.
        *   *Benefits*: Better diagnostics, more predictable error states.
        *   *Risks*: Small risk of changing error handling behavior relied upon by `cli.js`.
    *   **(Low Priority / Easy Effort)**: **Add JSDoc Documentation**: Add comprehensive JSDoc blocks to all exported functions.
        *   *Technique*: Documentation.
        *   *Benefits*: Improved understanding for developers, better IDE integration.
        *   *Risks*: Negligible.
    *   **(Low Priority / Easy Effort)**: **Extract Constants**: Replace magic strings (Git commands, error prefixes, stash format) with named constants.
        *   *Technique*: Introduce Constant.
        *   *Benefits*: Improved readability, easier maintenance.
        *   *Risks*: Negligible.

6.  **Code Examples**:

    *   **Refactoring `handlePackageChanges` (Conceptual)**:
        ```javascript
        // Before
        async function handlePackageChanges() {
          // ... long function handling multiple cases ...
        }

        // After (Conceptual Structure)
        async function checkLockfileStatus() {
          // ... check for conflicts or missing lockfile ...
          // Returns status like 'conflict', 'missing', 'ok'
        }

        async function resolveLockConflict() {
          // ... steps to resolve package-lock.json conflict ...
        }

        async function ensureDependenciesInstalled() {
          // ... run npm install if necessary ...
        }

        async function handlePackageChanges() {
          const spinner = ora("Checking package dependencies...").start();
          try {
            const status = await checkLockfileStatus();
            if (status === 'conflict') {
              spinner.text = 'Resolving package-lock.json conflicts...';
              await resolveLockConflict();
              spinner.succeed("Package lock file regenerated successfully");
              return true; // Indicate conflict was resolved
            } else if (status === 'missing') {
              spinner.text = 'Installing dependencies...';
              await ensureDependenciesInstalled();
              spinner.succeed("Dependencies handled successfully");
            } else {
               spinner.succeed("Dependencies handled successfully");
            }
            return false; // Indicate no conflict was present/resolved
          } catch (error) {
            spinner.fail("Failed to handle package changes");
            throw error;
          }
        }
        ```

7.  **Testing Recommendations**:
    *   Add unit tests for `execGit` (mocking `execa`).
    *   Add unit tests for `saveGitState`, `restoreGitState`, `getCurrentBranch`, `getBaseBranch`, `getAppliedPatches` (mocking `execGit`).
    *   Add unit tests for the refactored parts of `handlePackageChanges` (mocking `execGit`, `fs`, `execa` for npm).
    *   Add integration tests that:
        *   Initialize a test Git repo.
        *   Call `saveGitState`, make changes, call `restoreGitState`, and verify the state is restored.
        *   Simulate `package-lock.json` conflicts and verify `handlePackageChanges` resolves them.
        *   Verify `syncBranches` correctly interacts with a mock remote.

### File Reviewed: `bin/cli.js`

1.  **Summary**:
    *   This script defines the main entry point and command-line interface for the `hypkg` tool using the `commander` library. It orchestrates various workflows like initializing projects, applying/removing/listing/syncing patches (mods), managing Git branches for development and releases, searching for patches, and managing remote patch repositories. It relies heavily on the `utils.js` module for Git and file system interactions and uses `inquirer` for user prompts. It also includes logic for fetching data from GitHub.

2.  **Key Metrics** (Estimates):
    *   Lines of Code: ~4300+ (Very Large)
    *   Complexity: Very High. Numerous long functions, deep nesting, complex conditional logic, extensive interactions with Git, file system, network, and user prompts.
    *   Test Coverage: 0% (No tests provided).

3.  **Strengths**:
    *   **Comprehensive Functionality**: Implements a wide range of features for managing Hyperfy mods.
    *   **Interactive UX**: Uses `inquirer` for user-friendly prompts and `ora` for visual feedback during operations.
    *   **Use of `commander`**: Structures the CLI commands and options effectively.
    *   **Centralized Utilities**: Leverages `utils.js` for core Git/FS operations, reducing direct low-level calls in the CLI logic itself.
    *   **Repository Management**: Includes features for adding/removing/listing remote repositories.
    *   **Enhanced Commit/Patch Metadata**: Implements a system for embedding and parsing metadata within commit messages (`generateEnhancedCommitMessage`, `parseEnhancedCommitMessage`).

4.  **Issues**:
    *   **Critical**: **Massive File Size**: Over 4300 lines in a single file makes it extremely difficult to navigate, understand, maintain, and test. This is the single biggest issue hindering refactoring.
    *   **Critical**: **Lack of Testing**: Given the complexity and the critical nature of operations (Git manipulation, releases), the absence of tests makes any change extremely risky.
    *   **Critical**: **Long Functions**: Many command action handlers (`apply`, `remove`, `sync`, `update`, `release`, `update-all`, `interactiveInstall`) and helper functions (`applyPatchFromRepo`, `removePatch`, `listPatches`, `syncPatches`, `releaseBranch`, `updateBranch`) are excessively long, performing too many steps and violating the Single Responsibility Principle.
    *   **Major**: **High Coupling**: Tight coupling exists between command handlers and `utils.js`, and significant coupling *within* `cli.js` itself due to many shared helper functions defined globally in the script scope.
    *   **Major**: **Inconsistent Error Handling**: While `try...catch` is used extensively, the handling strategy varies. Errors might be logged, spinners failed, or `process.exit(1)` called. Propagating errors through long async chains can be complex to trace. Aborting operations (e.g., `cherry-pick --abort`, `rebase --abort`) on failure is good but adds complexity.
    *   **Major**: **Code Duplication**: Significant potential for duplication exists across command handlers and helper functions, especially in areas like:
        *   Fetching/parsing patch/commit metadata.
        *   Finding specific commits (e.g., in `removePatch`, `applyPatchFromRepo`).
        *   Prompting the user (`inquirer` patterns).
        *   Spinner (`ora`) usage and text updates.
        *   Git command sequences (even if using `utils.execGit`, the orchestration might be similar).
        *   Repository interaction logic (fetching, checking remotes).
        *   Parsing namespaced patch names.
    *   **Medium**: **Poor Readability**: The combination of file size, long functions, deep nesting (`try...catch`, promise chains, conditionals), and interspersed helper functions significantly impacts readability.
    *   **Medium**: **Hard-coded Values**: Numerous strings like commit prefixes (`cow:`, `cow_`), branch prefixes (`cow_`), config keys (`hyperfy.mod.*`), remote names (`hyperfy`, `origin`), separators (`---COMMIT_SEPARATOR---`), GitHub URLs are hard-coded.
    *   **Minor**: **Limited Documentation**: Many functions, especially complex helpers and command handlers, lack sufficient JSDoc comments explaining their purpose, logic flow, parameters, and error handling.
    *   **Minor**: **Global Helper Functions**: Many helper functions are defined in the global scope of the script, making dependencies unclear and increasing coupling.

5.  **Refactoring Plan**:
    *   **(Critical Priority / Hard Effort)**: **Modularize `cli.js`**: Break the single file into multiple smaller, focused modules.
        *   *Technique*: Move Method/Function, Extract Module. Create directories like `commands/` (one file per command: `apply.js`, `list.js`, etc.), `lib/` (shared logic: `git-helpers.js`, `patch-parser.js`, `repo-manager.js`, `github-client.js`, `prompts.js`, `ui.js` for spinners/logging).
        *   *Benefits*: Drastically improves navigation, readability, maintainability, and testability. Enables parallel work. Clarifies dependencies.
        *   *Risks*: Significant structural change, high risk without tests. Requires careful planning of module boundaries and interfaces. Must be done incrementally.
    *   **(Critical Priority / Hard Effort)**: **Introduce Testing**: Add comprehensive unit, integration, and potentially end-to-end tests (using CLI testing tools).
        *   *Technique*: TDD/BBD. Mock dependencies (`utils.js`, `inquirer`, `ora`, `execa`, `fs`, network). Test command parsing, option handling, core logic flows within refactored modules.
        *   *Benefits*: Enables safe refactoring, prevents regressions, documents behavior.
        *   *Risks*: Complex setup, especially for integration/E2E tests involving CLI interaction and Git state.
    *   **(High Priority / Hard Effort)**: **Refactor Long Functions**: Systematically apply the "Extract Method" refactoring to break down long command handlers and helper functions into smaller, testable units within the new modules.
        *   *Technique*: Extract Method.
        *   *Benefits*: Improved readability, testability, reduced complexity.
        *   *Risks*: Requires careful identification of logical units to extract. High risk without pre-existing tests covering the original function's behavior.
    *   **(High Priority / Medium Effort)**: **Consolidate Duplication**: Identify and consolidate repeated logic patterns into shared functions within the new `lib/` modules.
        *   *Technique*: Extract Method, Replace Duplicate Code with Call to Shared Function.
        *   *Benefits*: Reduces code size, improves maintainability (fix bugs in one place).
        *   *Risks*: Ensuring the consolidated function correctly handles all original contexts.
    *   **(Medium Priority / Medium Effort)**: **Standardize Error Handling**: Define a consistent strategy for error handling, logging, and exiting. Consider custom error classes.
        *   *Technique*: Introduce Custom Error Classes, Standardize Exception Handling.
        *   *Benefits*: More predictable behavior, easier debugging.
        *   *Risks*: Requires careful review of all error paths.
    *   **(Medium Priority / Easy Effort)**: **Extract Constants**: Move hard-coded strings and values to a dedicated constants module.
        *   *Technique*: Introduce Constant.
        *   *Benefits*: Improved readability, easier configuration/maintenance.
        *   *Risks*: Negligible.
    *   **(Medium Priority / Medium Effort)**: **Improve Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments to all functions within the new modules, explaining purpose, parameters, return values, and errors.
        *   *Technique*: Documentation.
        *   *Benefits*: Improved understanding, better maintainability.
        *   *Risks*: Negligible.

        ```

    *   **Refactoring Long Function (Conceptual)**:
        ```javascript
        // In commands/apply.js (after refactoring cli.js)
        const prompts = require('../lib/prompts');
        const patchParser = require('../lib/patch-parser');
        const repoManager = require('../lib/repo-manager');
        const gitHelpers = require('../lib/git-helpers');
        const ui = require('../lib/ui');
        const constants = require('../lib/constants');

        async function applyPatches(patchNames, options) {
          if (patchNames.length === 0) {
            patchNames = await prompts.selectPatchesToApply();
            if (patchNames.length === 0) {
               ui.log("No patches selected", "info");
               return;
            }
          }

          if (options.version) {
             if (patchNames.length > 1) {
                throw new Error(constants.errors.VERSION_WITH_MULTIPLE_PATCHES);
             }
             await applySingleVersionedPatch(patchNames[0], options.version);
          } else {
             await applyMultiplePatches(patchNames);
          }

          // await envHandler.setupEnvironment(); // If extracted
          await ui.displayAppliedPatches(); // Wrapper around listPatches logic
        }

        async function applySingleVersionedPatch(fullPatchName, version) {
           const { remote, patchName } = await patchParser.parseFullPatchName(fullPatchName);
           const spinner = ui.spinner(`Installing ${patchName} v${version} from ${remote}`);
           try {
              const metadata = await gitHelpers.getVersionMetadata(remote, patchName, version);
              await gitHelpers.applyCommit(metadata.tagRef, metadata, spinner);
              spinner.succeed(`Successfully installed ${remote}/${patchName} v${version}`);
           } catch (error) {
              spinner.fail(`Failed to install version: ${error.message}`);
              await gitHelpers.abortCherryPickSilently(); // Example helper
              throw error;
           }
        }

        async function applyMultiplePatches(patchNames) {
           for (const fullPatchName of patchNames) {
              const { remote, patchName } = await patchParser.parseFullPatchName(fullPatchName);
              // Use applyPatchFromRepo logic (refactored into git-helpers perhaps)
              await gitHelpers.applyLatestPatchFromBranch(remote, patchName);
           }
        }

        // ... export applyPatches as the command action handler ...
        ```

7.  **Testing Recommendations**:
    *   Add unit tests for all functions in the new `lib/` modules (e.g., `patch-parser`, `prompts`, `ui`, `repo-manager`), mocking dependencies.
    *   Add unit tests for each command module in `commands/`, mocking the `lib/` modules and `utils.js` to test the command's orchestration logic, argument/option handling.
    *   Add integration tests for key command flows (`apply`, `remove`, `sync`, `release`, `update`) that interact with a test Git repository via the `utils.js` layer.
    *   Consider CLI snapshot testing or E2E tests using tools like `jest-cli-snapshot` or custom scripts to verify command output and behavior.

## Final Report: Executive Summary

1.  **Overall Assessment**:
    *   The `hypkg` codebase provides significant functionality for managing Hyperfy modifications via Git. However, its current state presents **high technical debt**, primarily due to the monolithic structure of `bin/cli.js` (over 4300 lines) and a complete **lack of automated tests**. While `utils.js` offers some abstraction, the overall maintainability, readability, and testability are very low, making refactoring **extremely risky** without significant upfront investment in testing and modularization.

2.  **Critical Paths for Refactoring**:
    *   **Modularization of `bin/cli.js`**: This is the highest priority. The single large file must be broken down into smaller, manageable modules (e.g., by command, by shared library function).
    *   **Introduction of Testing**: A comprehensive test suite (unit, integration) is non-negotiable before any significant refactoring can be safely undertaken. Testing should focus first on `utils.js` and then progressively cover the refactored modules from `cli.js`.
    *   **Refactoring Long Functions**: Key complex functions like `syncPatches`, `applyPatchFromRepo`, `removePatch`, `releaseBranch`, `updateBranch`, and the main command handlers must be broken down using the "Extract Method" pattern once modules are established and basic tests are in place.

3.  **Quick Wins** (Relatively Lower Effort, High Impact - *only after initial testing/modularization begins*):
    *   **Extract Constants**: Moving hard-coded strings (`cow_`, commit message formats, Git commands) to a constants file improves readability and maintainability.
    *   **Add JSDoc**: Documenting functions in `utils.js` and newly created modules improves understanding.
    *   **Improve Error Handling Consistency**: Standardizing how errors are caught, logged, and propagated from `utils.js` and within `cli.js` modules.

4.  **Long-term Improvements**:
    *   **Robust Logging**: Implement a proper logging library instead of `console.log` and the basic `DEBUG` flag.
    *   **CLI Testing Framework**: Adopt a framework for end-to-end CLI testing to ensure user workflows remain intact.
    *   **Dependency Injection**: Introduce dependency injection for easier testing and decoupling, especially for dependencies like `utils.js`, `inquirer`, `ora`.
    *   **State Management**: Consider a more formal approach to managing internal state during complex operations like `sync` or `release`, beyond simple `try...catch` and `restoreGitState`.

5.  **Refactoring Roadmap**:
    1.  **(Setup)** Establish testing frameworks (Jest recommended) and configuration for unit and integration testing (including Git repo setup/teardown).
    2.  **(Test `utils.js`)** Write comprehensive tests for `utils.js`, identifying and fixing any bugs or error handling issues found. Refactor `handlePackageChanges` and improve error handling here.
    3.  **(Modularize `cli.js` - Incrementally)**:
        *   Start extracting pure helper functions (e.g., `parseEnhancedCommitMessage`, `getTagCompatibleName`, `getRelativeTime`) into `lib/` modules and add tests.
        *   Create the `commands/` structure. Start moving simple commands (e.g., `list`, `search`) into their own files, creating necessary `lib/` modules for shared logic (like `ui.js`, `prompts.js`), and add unit tests mocking dependencies.
        *   Tackle more complex commands (`apply`, `remove`, `sync`, `release`, `update`, `install`) one by one, extracting logic into `lib/` modules (e.g., `git-helpers.js`, `patch-parser.js`) and adding unit tests for both the command file and the extracted library functions. Integration tests become crucial here.
    4.  **(Consolidate Duplication)** As modules are created, identify and refactor duplicated logic into shared `lib/` functions.
    5.  **(Refine and Document)** Improve JSDoc across the newly structured codebase. Refine error handling. Extract remaining constants.

6.  **Resource Requirements** (Estimate):
    *   Significant time investment required due to the codebase size, complexity, and lack of tests.
    *   **Phase 1 (Testing `utils.js`, Basic Modularization/Testing `cli.js`)**: Likely requires several developer-weeks.
    *   **Phase 2 (Full Modularization, Complex Command Refactoring, Comprehensive Testing)**: Potentially 1-3 developer-months, depending on the desired level of test coverage and refactoring depth.
    *   Expertise in Node.js, asynchronous programming, Git internals, testing methodologies (unit, integration, mocking), and CLI application structure is needed.

7.  **Success Metrics**:
    *   **Test Coverage**: Achieve target unit and integration test coverage (e.g., >80%).
    *   **Code Complexity**: Reduction in cyclomatic complexity scores for refactored functions/modules.
    *   **File Size**: Drastic reduction in the size of `bin/cli.js` and distribution of lines across new modules.
    *   **Maintainability Index**: Improvement in static analysis tool scores (if used).
    *   **Bug Rate**: Reduction in bugs reported or regressions introduced during subsequent feature development.
    *   **Developer Velocity**: Faster implementation of new features or bug fixes due to improved structure and test safety net.
    *   **Readability**: Subjective improvement assessed by developer team review.
